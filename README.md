Our platform redefines digital lending by integrating an on-chain AI agent built using Arbitrum Stylus, which generates dynamic credit scores and allocates collateral based on real-time data. Each user receives an NFT encapsulating their credit profile and collateral details, ensuring transparency and trust throughout the lending process. Additionally, by leveraging Coinbase's Agent Kit, our system proactively manages token movements during sudden market shifts to protect against volatility.

## Overview

Our platform automates lending by integrating:
- **Instant Credit Assessment:** On-chain AI generates real-time credit scores.
- **NFT-Backed Digital Identity:** Immutable NFTs capture each user's credit and collateral data.
- **Dynamic Collateral Management:** Automated adjustments based on market conditions.
- **Automated Risk Mitigation:** Real-time monitoring and liquidation to safeguard assets.
- **DefAI Integration:** Coinbase's Agent Kit ensures swift token management during market volatility.

## Key Features

- **Instant Credit Scoring:**  
  The on-chain AI agent processes real-time data to generate a unique credit score for each user, eliminating delays associated with traditional credit checks.

- **NFT-Backed Trust:**  
  Minted NFTs represent a user's credit and collateral profile, creating a secure, immutable record that enhances transparency.

- **Dynamic Collateral Allocation:**  
  Collateral requirements are adjusted automatically based on real-time market data to protect both lenders and borrowers.

- **Automated Risk Management:**  
  Our integrated CDP agent kit continuously monitors token prices. In the event of a significant price drop, it automatically liquidates a portion of the collateral to manage risk.

- **DefAI & Token Movement:**  
  Using Coinbase's Agent Kit, the platform swiftly moves tokens in response to market fluctuations, ensuring liquidity is maintained even during volatile periods.

## How It Works

1. **Credit Scoring:**  
   The AI agent evaluates real-time data to generate a credit score for each borrower, which determines the necessary collateral.

2. **Collateral Allocation:**  
   Based on the credit score, the platform assigns and secures collateral, then mints an NFT representing the user's credit profile and collateral details.

3. **Risk Monitoring & Management:**  
   The CDP agent kit monitors token prices continuously. If a significant drop is detected, the system triggers automated liquidations to rebalance collateral levels.

4. **DefAI Integration:**  
   Leveraging Coinbase's Agent Kit, the platform ensures that token transfers occur seamlessly and promptly during sudden market movements, maintaining system stability.

## Challenges Encountered

- **Computational Overhead On-Chain:**  
  Running neural networks on-chain presented significant computational challenges. We had to optimize our AI models to ensure efficient execution within blockchain constraints without sacrificing predictive accuracy.

- **Scarcity of Test Data for Training:**  
  The decentralized nature of the platform limited access to traditional test data. To overcome this, we synthesized data and simulated various scenarios to train our AI models effectively.

- **Managing Liquidity Amid Price Fluctuations:**  
  Continuous monitoring of token prices is critical. Our system had to be robust enough to handle rapid market changes and execute timely liquidations, ensuring liquidity and stability for both borrowers and lenders.
